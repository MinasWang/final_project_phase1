Using kinect without turtlebot:
step 1: run a fake turtlebot. 
	roslaunch rbx1_bringup fake_turtlrbot.launch
step 2: connect to the laser
	roslaunch rbx1_bringup fake_laser.launch
step 3: using gmapping to catch an initial map from laser.
	roslaunch rbx1_nav gmapping_demo.launch
step 4: using rviz to visualize the process.
	rosrun rviz rviz -d `rospack find rbx1_nav` /gmapping.rviz
step 5: bring up the turtlebot controller.
	roslaunch rbx1_nav keyboard_teleop.launch

after you map all the environment you need.
step 6: save the map
	rosrun map_server map_saver -f test_map_name


Mapping in the real robot is similar with the above.
step 1: connect two computers.
        change the ~/.bashrc file for the variables of ROS_HOSTNAME 
	and ROS_MASTERURI.

step 2: connect the turtle in the turtlebot's laptop
	roslaunch rbx1_bringup turtlebot_minial_create.launch

step 3: connect the laser in the turtlebot's laptop
	roslaunch rbx1_bringup fake_laser.launch

step 4: now you can run the rest command in your laptop as above.
